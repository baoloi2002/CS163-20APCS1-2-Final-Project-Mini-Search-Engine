Seeing the danger, the eldest brother went to the high mountain, piled two big bonfires, and called the second brother to save him. Seeing the fire signal, Leo immediately aimed in the direction of the fire and ran like the wind, regardless of day and night. Arriving at his mother's hometown, he ran straight to Xa Tinh cave and met it sharpening its claws in front of the cave. Without saying a word, Leo aimed at its face and launched a javelin as powerful as thunder. Knowing that the brave family had come again, Xa Tinh immediately tried to test his talent. Backing away from the javelin, it picked up a handful of leaves, chanted a spell, and threw it into the sky. Immediately a swarm of wasps appeared and rushed over. The young Leo calmly removed the flower from the top and planted it lightly on the ground. Immediately throughout a forest, colorful flowers spread out and woven into a wonderfully beautiful carpet. The bees smelled of nectar, swooping down to cling to black. They burrow into flowers to suck nectar. Suddenly, the flower shivered and closed its wings, locking the ghostly bees inside.

Seeing that his magic was damaged, the Serpent roared, took out the bright red orb, and shouted

- You will have to run like the first two brats until this gem!

Seeing the fire rising high, the forest burning fierce and fierce, Leo immediately took off the magic water pipe he wore on his back and poured it on the ground. Cool jets of water shot out and then suddenly rose into giant springs of water wrapped in fire. Before long, the fire of the Serpent was extinguished by the springs of water. Losing, the Serpent became even more furiously roaring. He collected the red orb and swung the pale white gem. Immediately the waves surged up, and the rain poured like water in a pipe. The water rose so quickly that the second brother couldn't stand it, so he had to follow the direction of the setting sun and run to the mountain.

The eldest brother saw that his brothers couldn't treat the Snake Crystal and was extremely worried. Seeing that, the village was also very worried. They immediately joined forces, contributed to building a long ladder, crossed the river, asked the eldest brother to climb up and ask God if there was any magic to help the villagers kill the Serpent. The eldest brother climbed the ladder to Heaven right away.

That morning, Troi woke up late, and when he opened his eyes, he saw the eldest brother kneeling in front of him, telling the story clearly and asking God to help him fight the Snake. Thinking for a moment, the sky nodded and said:

â€“ This Serpent is indeed very magical. But the children's intelligence is no less than that. It's only because you don't know how to team up and fight that you can cure this spell, it casts another spell. Well, now let's go back to the high mountain, light a fire and call the two of you home. Then all three brothers teamed up to try. If we still lose, we will come up with another way.

The eldest brother obeyed, returned to the high mountain to light a fire to call the two brothers again. The three brothers reunited with the villagers, divided into three routes, leading directly to the Serpent's lair.

While eating white buffalo liver and drinking black wine with his head down, suddenly seeing three brave men standing in front of the cave, the snake immediately growled:

- Behold, the three young rabbits have come and surrendered their lives. Wait there, after eating and drinking, I will question you.

The oldest brother replied, his voice as loud as a gong:

- Youkai, today you will have to pay. You have destroyed this mountain and forest, killed this villager, now we will join forces to punish you.

Sagittarius is very angry. It jumped out of the cave, holding out the green gem. A storm arose. Quick as lightning, the eldest brother swung his shield, raised it to the east, and the mountains to the east fell; raised to the west, mountains to the west fall. The shield rotated, blowing the wind away from the Serpent's storm. Serpent lost the first match, quickly pulled out the white pearl. The flood water came rushing in. The youngest brother rushed out into the middle of the water, raised his sword, and stomped on the ground. Immediately, layers of ramparts emerged, surrounding and locking up the water flow. Seeing the miracle being damaged, the Serpent hastily picked up the red gem. Fire smoke
