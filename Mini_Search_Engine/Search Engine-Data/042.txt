Talking again Truc, from the day he quit school, inherited a part of the land left by his grandparents. He knows how to manage and work hard. So in just ten years, he became well off: deep fields of buffalo, sows, areca groves and fish ponds were enough to provide him and his family with a prosperous life.

But Truc has a cheating temperament. Although he was rich, he still did not want to lose a single penny to anyone. Because of that, he forgot all the promises he made to his old friends:

– “Oh well! Find what to do to lose work. They don't even remember you anymore." Thinking so, Truc was very confident about his actions.

When meeting Truc, seeing Truc rich, to test old friends. Tung did not rush to talk about his successful situation: only said that because he missed his friends, he came to the house to play. See Tung's appearance. Truc guessed old and young that Tung was lucky enough to have enough to eat, now finding his house is not smart to use borrowed money. Thinking so, after greeting Tung, Truc also pretended to be difficult:

– “To be honest with you, if I didn't have some bad business, I wouldn't be this inferior to you. At that time, I was going to go out to Hue to look for him, but because of several consecutive crop failures, followed by a terrible famine, there were some fields in the house that had to be taken away, only recently to be redeemed."

Truc said a lot more, intentionally to lock Tung's mouth if he intended to borrow money. And to show that he is really poor, Truc treats you according to the normal level. The next morning, when the servant of the Truc family came to the owner to ask to make a net in the pond to get some fat sesame seeds for guests so that he could go to the field to plow the field, Truc stopped:

– Ouch! "Slowly cannot be maintained" (now gradually should not be in the pond) don't you remember that proverb? You want to ruin my career or why do you want to catch fish at this hour?
Knowing the will of the master, the servant quietly withdrew. That afternoon, when the chicken entered the coop, Truc's wife told the family to keep one chicken separately for slaughter. But when giving the chicken to cut blood, Truc rushed to the kitchen:

- OH! "Rooster can't kill chicken" (rooster should not kill chicken now), old soulmate can't eat anything, but killing chicken at this hour is very abstain!

When he went to Mai's house - his second best friend, Tung was still dressed as a poor man like when he went to Truc's house. And Tung still kept hidden from revealing his true situation to Mai. Mai, from the time she quit school, returned to meet a desperate situation at home, he tried his best to resist but did not find the time. He went to trade for a few trips and suffered a loss of capital, turned to teaching, got sick, and had a few acres of land that his ancestors had to sell to run medicine.
