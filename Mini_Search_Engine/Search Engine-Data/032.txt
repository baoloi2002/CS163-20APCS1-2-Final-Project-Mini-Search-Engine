Once there was a poor woodcutter, his parents were seriously ill, so he died early, he had to live orphaned since childhood and his property was only an ax. Every day he had to carry an ax into the forest to cut firewood and sell it to earn money to make a living. At the edge of the forest there is a river with very fast flowing water, if someone slips and falls into the river, it is very difficult to swim to the shore.

One day, as usual, the woodcutter carried an ax into the forest to cut wood. While he was cutting firewood by the riverbank, his ax suddenly broke and its blade fell into the river. Because the river flows too fast, even though he knows how to swim, he still can't get into the river to find the ax blade. Disappointed, the woodcutter sat crying and lamenting.

A Fairy Tale of Honesty - Three Blades

Suddenly from somewhere an old man with white hair, long beard, very kind eyes appeared in front of him, the old man looked at the butler and asked:

- Hey, what are you doing that I see you crying and sad like that?

The woodcutter answered the old man:

-Sir, my parents died early, I had to live an orphan since I was young, my family background is very poor, my only property is the iron ax that my parents left before my death. With that ax, I still go to the forest to cut firewood to earn a living, now it has fallen into the river, I don't know what to do for a living anymore. That's why I'm so sad!

The old man replied to the woodcutter:

"I thought it was a big deal, don't cry anymore, let me dive into the river to pick up the ax for you."

Finally, the old man threw himself into the fast flowing river. After a while, the old man emerged from the water holding a shining silver ax and asked the poor woodcutter:

â€œIs this the ax you dropped?

The woodcutter looked at the silver ax and saw that it was not his, so he shook his head and said to the old man:

- Not my grandson's ax blade, my ax blade is iron.

The second time, the old man plunged into the fast-flowing river to find an ax for the woodcutter. After a while, the old man emerged from the water with a golden ax in his hand and asked the woodcutter:

-Is this the ax that you accidentally dropped into the river?

The woodcutter looked at the shining golden ax, shook his head again and said:

-It's not my son's ax

The third time, the old man plunged into the river again and this time when he got up, he held in his hand an iron ax dropped by the woodcutter. The old man asked again:

-So is this your ax blade?

Seeing that it was his ax, the woodcutter exclaimed happily:

-Yes, this is my ax blade, thank you for finding me the ax blade so that I can cut wood to earn a living.

The old man gave the woodcutter his iron ax and praised:

-You are an honest and honest person, not greedy for money and profit. Now I give you these two gold and silver axes. This is my gift to you, please accept it happily.
