Vietnam currently has four COVID-19 vaccines produced by Nanogen, Vabiotech, Polyvac, and the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) currently under research. The health ministry has assessed the Nanocovax vaccine produced by Nanogen is the most promising, having been successfully produced on a laboratory scale and provoked immunogenicity during animal testing. IVAC and Vabiotech have completed their laboratory-scale production process and are evaluating the safety and immunity of their vaccines on animals. On 7 December, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology announced the Nanocovax test results on hamsters. The hamsters were vaccinated and then exposed to the novel coronavirus for 14 days. They were not infected and results from lung fluid tests also showed they were negative for the virus. Meanwhile, mice that were not vaccinated tested positive for the novel coronavirus and showed signs of fatigue. On 17 December 2020, Nanogen commenced human trials of the Nanocovax vaccine. On 26 February 2021, the pharmaceutical company began second phase trials in two places, Hanoi and southern Long An province. On 25 March, 26 volunteers receiving the first jabs in phase II between 26 February and 10 March were given the second shots of the Nanocovax vaccine. Some volunteers experienced side effects around the injection site, yet did not require medical intervention. Results of the trial will be issued in May 2021 before preparing for the third-stage trial, giving the vaccine to between 10,000 and 30,000 people to test for effectiveness and safety. Nanocovax vaccine may be ready to deliver to the general public inthe second half of 2021, if effectiveness is shown. If the government goes ahead with the emergency decision, it may be rolled out in May, a Nanogen official told Nikkei Asia. On 26 March, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Pham Cong Tac and Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam received the second dose of the Nanocovax COVID-19 vaccine.

On 21 January, the second Vietnam-produced COVID-19 vaccine (COVIVAC), developed by the Institute of Vaccine and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), entered a human-clinical trial, nearly two months ahead of schedule. IVAC has made studies on the vaccine since May 2020, and carried out pre-clinical trials in India, the United States, and Vietnam, with the results showing safety and efficacy in the experiment, fully meeting the conditions for conducting research with humans. The vaccine stability evaluation was conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City. On 15 March 2021, six volunteers were injected with the COVIVAC vaccine, at the Hanoi Medical University. The COVIVAC is a liquid vaccine with or without adjuvants, without preservatives, with the production technology of Newcastle vector vaccine, based on production technology on chicken eggs with embryos.

Following the approval of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on 30 January 2021, vaccinations commenced on 8 March 2021 and will continue throughout the year with the goal of vaccinating 80% of the population by June 2022. The Sputnik V was later approved for use on 23 March 2021. Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use on 4 June 2021, while Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were approved on 12 June 2021, 29 June 2021, and 15 July 2021, respectively.

This is the country's largest-ever immunization campaign with over 150 million doses. Although Vietnam is a success story in disease prevention and has kept outbreaks under control, the country's COVID-19 vaccination program is considered to be slower than most countries in Asia. As of 23 July 2021, Vietnam has administered 4,478,757 vaccine doses across the country. It is expected that a total of 124 million doses would be available by the end of 2021.

On 7 May 2021, Vietnam recorded the first death of a person vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, a female 35-year-old medical staff in An Giang Province.
