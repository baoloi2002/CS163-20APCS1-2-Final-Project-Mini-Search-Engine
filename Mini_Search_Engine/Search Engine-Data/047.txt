Before he finished his sentence, the tree cried again, tears kept falling down. Chicken Mo comforts no matter how much it does not stop the tree. Chicken Mo thought for a moment and then decided:

- I give you a red flower on my head.

Hearing Mai say that, the sentence suddenly brightened up and asked:

- Really? Can you tell me the truth?

- Really. I give you my flower. As for me, I'm Mai Mai, I don't need a crimson crest like that flower.

- Then I'm so happy, thank you!

The next morning, everyone was surprised to see where Mo's beautiful crest had disappeared. And the burgundy tree with elongated leaves beside the water tank blooms a bunch of beautiful and brilliant red flowers just like the crest of Ga Mo.

The flower tree happily reaches out to receive the sunlight every morning. The sunlight dyed the flower more red. The tree quietly told everyone the story of the Mo chicken's kindness. Everyone compliments the kindness of the Dream hen. When seeing a dream hen pass by, everything tilts its head to welcome and congratulate.

â€“ Wishing the good stomach of the hen The dream will give birth to precious jewels.

Since then, that flower is called the Cockroach flower to commemorate the kindness of the Dream hen. And the hen dreams of laying a beautiful pink egg every day.

On the Mo's head, there is also a small, beautiful new crest now.

Friendship is about sacrifice and empathy. Mo Chicken understands the pain of the flower tree, so he is ready to give his crest to the flower tree, which shows the beautiful friendship between the two. The story praises sincere friendship, which exists not only in the human world but also in animals, they also know how to share and love each other, always giving the best for each other.
According to Chinese legends: In the mountains of Ho Phu, there lived a woman selling alcohol named Wong. One day, a virtuous Zen master came to stay near the inn. Even though he had no money, he was warmly received by the landlady. The Zen master stayed there for about three years. Before leaving, he dug a well next to the inn. Everyone was surprised when a clear stream of water surged up, they tasted it and found it to be a fine wine. From then on, the owner became famous and rich.

Not long after, the Zen master stopped by the inn and asked the innkeeper about the wine well. This woman complains:

- Good wine, but I never have a spare.

The Zen master smiled and quietly wrote on the wall:

- Heaven and earth are vast, but human greed is even more immense. Although it is inexpensive, the owner still has wine to sell but is still not satisfied.

After writing, the Zen master quietly left, and the stream of wine also dried up.

The story offers a very valuable lesson. It is human need to be grateful for what we receive, should not ask for more to satisfy bottomless greed. Be grateful to those who have helped you, be grateful that your life is so full and good. Practice accepting simple happiness a little to live a more peaceful life. Those who forget the help of others will receive appropriate punishment.
