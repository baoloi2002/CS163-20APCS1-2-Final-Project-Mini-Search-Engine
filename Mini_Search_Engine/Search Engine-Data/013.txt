Once upon a time, in a certain mountain cave, there was a python. Its head is as big as a jar, it has a red crest on its head, its eyes are like two tangerines, and its body is longer than a staff. Wherever it goes, it turns into a storm, the trees fall, the dust rises. It has eaten countless animals and people. People used many methods to eradicate, but the python did not die, but was more destructive. In the end, the king had to order it to build a temple and promise to pray for one person's life every year so that it wouldn't destroy it. The king ordered the villages to give each year a daughter to offer the python, but also advertised in the country, whoever destroys that monster will make a duke and take the princess as his wife.

Defeat the Serpent

At that time there was a young man who had long been raised by a monk on a high mountain temple. Every day the monk taught him sword dance and martial arts. Successful, he was given a precious sword by the teacher and allowed to "lower the mountain". That day he returned to the village. After walking for an exhausting day, he saw a temple with a glimmer of light, not knowing it was a temple of snakes, so he stopped to rest. As soon as he entered the temple gate, he suddenly heard a whimpering sound inside, he was surprised and rushed to the upper hall. Under the light of an oil lamp, he saw a girl about eighteen or twenty years old, tied to a pole in an electric corner. He immediately walked over to her and untied her and said:

"How did you get tied up here?"

Girl wiping tears said:

- Who are you, in what country do you not know this is a temple of the snake?

Then she recounted the actions of the python, how one life each year, she finally sobbed:

â€“ My family has a mother and a child, thinking that I will die without regret, only loving the old mother who has no one to take care of. But let's go, quickly get out of this place, otherwise it won't be alive.

- When will it come here?

- Only for tonight!

Careful young man:

- I want to give her life for the python so that she can return to her mother.

The girl replied:

- I don't want others to die because of me. Just let me suffer this tragic fate, unjust money and karma. I just hope that if he ever passes through the village, please stop by to comfort his old mother and help me.

- Are not. Just get out of here and leave me with the monster.

Then, drawing his sword from its scabbard, he continued:

"It can't harm me. I'll take this one out and face it. She should run to the village quickly!

Saying that, he led the girl out of the forest, then returned to the temple neatly dressed, determined to wait for the snake.

Around midnight, suddenly outside there was a rustling sound, branches breaking. A fishy smell hit his nose until he vomited. The young man stood up, drew his sword, and hid in the upper hall. The familiar python as always, slowly wriggled through the wall and entered. But as soon as it poked its head into the temple, the young man immediately started the attack. His blade flashed in the darkness like lightning. The monster was wounded, rushing to try to swallow the enemy alive. But his powerful sword returned it with a second blow. The python was so painful, it roared, blew out a breath, and thrashed its tail so much that he rolled a few times. Fortunately, he was about to fall into the monster's mouth, but fortunately, he stood up in time and took a stance to give it a third shot, but because it was too strong, the tip of the sword was broken. He then took a few more hits, the python was seriously injured. Its whole body writhed so hard that the walls and roof of the temple collapsed, bricks and tiles rolled down the fence. He raised his sword and cut off the head of the beast.
