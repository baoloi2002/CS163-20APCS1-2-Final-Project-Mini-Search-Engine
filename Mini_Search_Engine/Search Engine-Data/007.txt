- I have this resurrection gem, I just need to put this gem and the nose, even if the dead person has been dead for three days, he will come back to life immediately.

Hearing the benefactor's words, he politely asked to hold the pearl to look at it for a while. When he held the pearl in his hand, he pretended to fiddle, admire, and then trick when the benefactor accidentally put it in his pocket, quickly grabbed his luggage, ran out into the street, and mixed in with the crowd. Losing the pearl, the Confucian boy chased and shouted loudly, but he quickly slipped into the alleys of the city and still couldn't find it, so he returned to the restaurant to sit and wait. After a while, the toad returned. Footstep Toad says:

- I told you not to save him, but if he was a good person, his companions would not have left him lying dead in the middle of that deserted place. But sooner or later, that pearl will return, now hurry up and tell the king so that later the king will judge and return the pearl to me.

Listening to the toad said, the Confucian scholar went to the court to report to the king and clearly explained the characteristics of the pearl to the king. The king promised to search for the pearl for him and punish the crooks. That night, the king's daughter suddenly fell down on the bed and fainted. The king and queen rushed to call the doctor to treat, after visiting the patient, the doctor said that the princess was seriously ill and could not be cured. The queen groaned and lamented, her tears flowed like a stream, the king sat watching his daughter about to die, her stomach tangled like a bubble. Suddenly the king remembered that the Confucian's pearl of resurrection was stolen in the afternoon, so he went to the board to find his name and announced throughout the city: "Whoever saves the princess's life will be chosen as a concubine". That news reached purple frog ears. Toad said to the owner:

- Very good ! This is a good opportunity for us to retrieve the jewel and find the thief, and it is also a rare opportunity for you to do so. Tomorrow morning, the jade thief in the guise of "a famous physician" will enter the palace to treat the princess. Please find a way to ask to go in and follow the court officials into the palace to visit the princess. When he saw someone bring out the pearl, he immediately went to the king to ask for his arrest.

The scholar listened. The next morning, he mixed with the line of martial arts officials and went to the palace to visit the princess. Purple Toad also jumped one step into the line.

Meanwhile, the guard at the gate led into the palace a man who called himself a famous doctor who could save the princess's life in an instant. The Confucian looked closely, realizing that it was indeed the one who had stolen his pearl the day before, and silently followed it.

Without delay, the "renowned doctor" pulled out from his pocket a jewel to make flowers, dance, recite a spell, and then put the jewel in the princess's nose. But to no avail, the princess lay still, cold. He hesitated, turning back and forth to the jewel several times. In the end, it was still okay to bring the princess back to life. The king and queen were extremely impatient.

In the meantime, the Confucianist turned the crowd and approached the king, he said, pointing to the face of the "famous doctor":

- Your Majesty, first of all, please let this guy be arrested.

The king suddenly remembered yesterday's lawsuit, and ordered the arrest of "famous doctor".

The Confucian took the pearl and pointed it at the toad - now in his hand - and explained to everyone:

â€“ This is the reincarnation pearl and this is the magic toad. Only the toad and I can use this gem to save the dead. Yesterday that guy stole my pearl. But he didn't know that he could never use the jewel without the toad's consent. Thanks to the king, now that I have recovered the pearl, I will ask to save the princess's life.

The king promises:

- Very good ! If you can save my son's life, I will keep my promises.
