Tu Thuc was still ecstatic, thinking he was dreaming, when suddenly there was a clear laughter behind him, he turned to see two girls in blue shirts giggling and saying to each other:

"Behold, our new groom has arrived"!

Then the two girls left. After a while, he came back and said, "Our lady let you in." From Awakening. Going through a courtyard, the two sides of the wall were embroidered with brocade, and when he reached a layer of vermilion doors, he saw hanging on the upper floor two golden paintings: "Quynh Hu chi palace and Giao Quang chi palace".

In the palace, a fairy dressed in white was sitting on a bed of seven treasures. The fairy invited Tu Thuc to sit on the chair next to her and said:

"He was originally enamored with strange scenes, he had been satisfied with his life and wandering around for so long, do you know where this place is"?

From Consciousness replied:

“I am a recluse living in the Tong Son district, traveling with a small boat in the middle of the sea. I did not know that this place has a pink and blue floor. My heart is still full of worldliness, I don't know where this is, please teach the scholar to understand."

Fairy said:

“Yes, how did you know this place? This is the sixth of thirty-six Phu Lai caves. In this place, the sea surrounds, hovering without touching the ground, just like La Phu mountain melts with the wind and rain, like Bong Lai mountain rising on the wave. I am Lady Wei, the fairy owner of Nanle Mountain. Because he saw that he was virtuous, he invited me to come”!

Then, the fairy raised her eyes and ordered the fairies to serve. A girl in blue brought out a young fairy from the inside. Tu Thuc glanced at him and recognized the person who broke the peony branch in the Flower Festival. The fairy pointed to the young woman and said to Tu Thuc:

“Her sister is my daughter, her name is Giang Huong. The day before, it had an accident in the Flower Festival, and was rescued by him. My heart still does not forget. I want her to marry you to repay that favor."

Then the fairy ordered the wedding to be held that same night, under the candlelight, on the embroidered dragon mat. The next day, fairies everywhere came to celebrate the new couple. Those wearing silk from the north ride a green dragon, those wearing silk from the south ride a golden cup, some ride a jade cart, some ride a rattan carriage... The fairies gather in the attic of Giao Quang with jade curtains and golden flutes.

When Kim Tien came, all the fairies went down to the palace to process them and sit on the crystal throne in the middle. As soon as the fairies sat down, the heavenly music played. All kinds of precious wine filled with sweet aroma poured out.

The fairy in silk said:

“We have roamed this area for nearly eighty thousand years, the southern sea has changed three times. Now the groom is not afraid to change his life, coming from far away to get married. I think the groom will not regret his old life and will no longer say that there are no fairies in this world”!

Kim Dong and Ngoc Nu are about to form long lines and start dancing. Lady Wei took the initiative to invite the party. Giang Huong poured wine and brought it to the hands of the fairies.

The young fairy wearing silk smiled and said:

“Our bride today is like fat, not as thin as before. It is often said that the daughter of the upper world has no husband. I can no longer believe that!”
