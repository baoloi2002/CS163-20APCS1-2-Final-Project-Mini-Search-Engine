- Yes. But if you want me to show you the way, you have to put me on your lap to warm me I'm freezing and about to turn to ice.

The mother held the thorn bush to her chest to keep it warm. The thorns pierced her flesh, the blood dripped heavily, but the thorns sprouted, green and blossomed in the middle of the cold winter night because of her mother's warmth. Then the thorn bush showed the mother the way.

She came to a large lake, without a single boat. The ice on the lake is too thin to be stepped on, and the lake water is too deep to wade through. But no matter what, she had to cross the lake to find her children. She collapsed to drink the lake water. Although she knew that it was something that humans could not do, the heartbroken mother longed for a miracle from God.

Ho told her:

- No, you can't do that! We negotiate better. I like pearls very much, and her eyes are transparent pearls, I have never seen them. Cry until her eyes fall; then I will take her to the greenhouse where Death lives and grows flowers. Each tree is a human life.

Sobbing mother:

- Sky ! I still regret to find my baby!

She cried, her tears flowed so heavily that her eyes followed the stream of tears to the bottom of the lake and turned into two pearls. So she was lifted up by the lake as if sitting on a swing, and in a flash she came to a wonderful house about a mile long.

I don't understand if it's a mountain with deep forests and deep caves or a human design work. The mother's eyes were already filled with tears, so she couldn't see anything. She asked:

- Where can I find that Death took my child?

An old woman guarding Death's glass nursery said to her:

- Death has not returned. How did she get to this place? Who helped her?

- God who! – The mother replied, “He had pity on me, so she also took pity on me and told me where my son was going.

Old lady said:

"I don't know his face, and you can't see anything." So many trees, so many flowers withered last night. Death will soon come to plant again. You probably know that each person has a tree or a flower that represents his or her life. Here, the flowers are nothing out of the ordinary, but they have a heart and that heart beats. Children's hearts also beat. There you go find it! Maybe you'll recognize your baby's heartbeat. But if you want me to guide you further, how can you thank me?

The poor mother lamented: 
I have nothing left to give, but if need be, I can follow you to the ends of the world.

- What did I come here for? She could even give me her long, jet-black hair. She knew that her hair was beautiful. I really like that hair and will give you my gray hair. That's the exchange.

Mother says:

"If that's all you ask, I'll be happy."

Then she gave the black hair to the old woman and accepted the gray hair.
